# GDShader Playground

**Godot version:** 4.3

A light-weight web app for editing [Godot Engine](https://godotengine.org/)
shaders on the go.
Play with it [here](https://auranym.github.io/gdshader-playground/)!

I created this app so that I could play with Godot shaders on my phone,
and it does the job decently well while still being very minimal.
This was just a fun project to explore working with Godot web builds,
so I don't intend on maintaining it.
